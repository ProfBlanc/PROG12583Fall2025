A function is a request to order something
Used to package/box/wrap-up a series of steps

A variable stores 1 data type
A data type can store 1 or many values.
    - one if primitive (int, str, float, bool)
    - many if collection/iterable type (list, tuple, set, diction)

A function aka method stores a series of statements
These statements help in produce a result

To describe anything, you need to answer the 5 W's 

Who         program/programmer via the user is making the request
Where       at the line that the function is DECLARED (has keyword def)
What        what the function accomplished
When        at the line that the function is CALLED
How         the statements that the function execute => producing the result


We are going to focus on the HOW. Why? 

HOW is a process.
process is similar to a sentance

NOUN + VERB

Noun: something that holds a value aka a variable
Verb: an action => a calculation

Many noun and many verbs

My friend and I are walking

nouns = ['friend', 'I']
verb = walking(person)

for p in nouns:
    walking(p)
